[Notation](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation) is an open source tool developed by the [Notary Project](https://notaryproject.dev/), which supports signing and verifying container images and other artifacts. The AWS Signer Notation plugin, allows users of Notation ([notation CLI](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation) and [notation-go](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go)) to sign and verify artifacts (such as container images) using AWS Signer. [AWS Signer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html) is a fully managed code-signing service to ensure the trust and integrity of your code. AWS Signer manages the code-signing certificates, secures private keys, and manages key rotation without requiring users to take any action.

The plugin is compliant with the [Notary Project specification](https://github.com/notaryproject/specifications/tree/main). It uses the AWS Signer _SignPayload_ API for signing, and _GetRevocationStatus_ API for signature verification.

## Getting Started
To use AWS Signer Notation plugin:

* Notation CLI  - Please refer [AWS Signer documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signer/latest/developerguide/container-workflow.html) for guidance on signing and verifying OCI artifacts.
* notation-go library -  You can use this plugin as library with notation-go, eliminating the need for invoking plugin executable. Please refer the provided [examples](https://github.com/aws/aws-signer-notation-plugin/tree/main/examples) on how to use plugin as library with notation-go.

## Building from Source

1. Install go. For more information, refer [go documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. The plugin uses go modules for dependency management. For more information, refer [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
3. Run `make build` to build the AWS Signer Notation plugin.
4. Upon completion of the build process, the plugin executable will be created at `build/bin/notation-com.amazonaws.signer.notation.plugin`.

Now you can use this plugin executable with notation CLI by using the following command:

`notation plugin install --file ./build/bin/notation-com.amazonaws.signer.notation.plugin`
